=======

Domain driven development compiled entity and mapper implementation. Entities and filters are built by a compiler into PHP code. Mappers facilitate the persistence of those entities into some sort of backend -- like MongoDB by default (though interchangeably Memcached, Redis, etc.). Services utilize mappers and entities to satisfy business requirements.

This project is in early development as part of another larger commercial product. I am actively working on it and plan to blog and document it for the masses in the near future in order to (hopefully) gain some outside contributions and insight.
